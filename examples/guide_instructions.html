<p>
  A friend needs your help to follow an invisible path only you can see, in a house full of
  dangerous traps! To ensure that our friend is safe, you must record instructions for them to
  follow. You may be asked to speak in a language other than English. Please read ALL of the
  instructions before starting.
</p>
<h3>Path</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The path is shown to you as a colored line that transitions from
    <strong style="color: #0000ff;">BLUE</strong> to <strong style="color: #ff0000;">RED</strong>
    as you approach the end.
  </li>
  <li>
    Our friend's initial orientation at the start of the path is shown as a
    <strong style="color: #008800;">GREEN</strong> arrow.
  </li>
  <li>
    The end of the path is highlighted with a <strong style="color: #008800;">GREEN</strong> circle.
  </li>
  <li>
    This path is invisible to your friend, and shouldn't be mentioned in your instructions.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Recording</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Note that after you press the begin button, your voice will be recorded.
  </li>
  <li>
    As you move through the environment, speak clearly and audibly to record your instructions for
    our friend to follow.
  </li>
  <li>
    The recording must only include YOUR voice. If other voices intrude, please press the reload
    button to start over.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure to mention OBJECTS and LANDMARKS, to make your instructions as clear and
    unambiguous as possible. To ensure our friend is safe from dangerous traps, they must follow the
    EXACT path you see.

    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Here's a GOOD example:
        <blockquote>
          <i>Okay look around until you can see the open door and go outside. You'll see an
            open balcony with a city behind it and a bed in front of you. Turn around so you
            can see the stairs. Go up the stairs. And stop on top of the carpet right next to
            a large plant that's resting against the wall.</i>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        And here's a BAD example:
        <blockquote>
          <i>Turn left. Go straight. Turn slight left again. Go a little bit forward. Exit the
            door.</i>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Movement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Look around the room by dragging the screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move around the room by double-clicking. The <strong style="color: #bbbb00;">YELLOW</strong>
    square indicates where you will move to next upon double-clicking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Record your instructions as you move around the room and look at the path and objects you are
    describing. Do NOT write down your instructions and read them off at the end. Do NOT traverse
    the path multiple times to check your work.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you have reached the end of the path, press the stop button. This will allow you to
    transcribe your recorded instructions into text.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your instructions will be evaluated by whether our friend can later follow the path and
    safely reach the end without encountering any dangerous traps.
  </li>
</ul>
